        DunaInSpaceLow* = The southern hemisphere shows signs of remanant magnetization. This is a sign that Duna once had a strong magnetic field comparable to Kerbin.
        DunaInSpaceLow* = Duna once had a strong magnetic field generated by a molten iron core, but this core may have cooled and solidified, causing the magnetic field to weaken and disappear.

        DunaInSpaceHigh* = Duna's weak magnetic field is almost undetectable at this altitude.
        DunaInSpaceHigh* = At this altitude, the spacecraft is not protected by Duna's magnetic field and is being battered by the solar wind.
