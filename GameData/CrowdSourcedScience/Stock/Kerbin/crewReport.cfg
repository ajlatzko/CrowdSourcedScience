        KerbinInSpaceLow* = Are we there yet?
        KerbinInSpaceLow* = We should have fixed the GPS before taking off so we'd know what biome we're in. Oh well, rocket fuel is expensive.

        KerbinInSpaceLow* = You prepare your bathing suit in case Mission Control wants you to land there.
        KerbinInSpaceLow* = From this height, you can clearly see where hard ice meets harsh rock meets cold snow. Not a very nice place to live.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = KSC, I hope you know where I am, cause I just spilled coffee on the roadmap.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = Ooh that aurora is pretty! Wonder what it looks like from the ground?
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You really want to get out and take a walk, but there's nothing to walk on.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You make an observation, but the lack of gravity stops your pen from working. Perhaps you should have brought a pencil.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = The surface of Kerbin is the shore of the cosmic ocean. Recently you've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = Wow, that ocean really is big. You're glad you aren't trying to sail across it.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = As you watch Kerbin's oceans from the depths of outer space you ask KSC if there are space pirates. KSC assures you that pirate ships have sails instead of rockets and thus cannot achieve orbit.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You can't see any plant life below, and can't decide whether it's because you are too far away, or that nothing grows here.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = Is it still the Highlands if you're over a quarter million meters above it?
