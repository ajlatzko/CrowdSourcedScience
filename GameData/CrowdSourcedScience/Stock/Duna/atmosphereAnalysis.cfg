        //DunaSrfLanded* = Lots of carbon dioxide... and not much else. Extremophile plants could potentially live here.
        //DunaSrfLanded* = 255. Definitely 255.

        DunaSrfLandedPoles* = The water ice crystals here contain levels of deuterium several times higher than on Kerbin.
        DunaSrfLandedPoles* = The atmosphere is composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlands* = You notice the Atmosphere Analyzer says the warranty is void, but you still think using it was a good idea.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlands* = After getting some strange readings, you open up the analysis chamber to check the instruments. A large amount of dust pours out onto the ground.

        DunaSrfLandedLowlands* = The surface pressure seems to vary wildly as the levels of carbon dioxide and water vapor change with the seasons.
        DunaSrfLandedLowlands* = The dust here is fine enough that the sensor doesn't get clogged for once! Rejoice!

        DunaSrfLandedCraters* = Mission Control says there's air here, but you can't breathe it. You wonder why Duna would even bother having one in that case. It's probably making fun of you or something.
        DunaSrfLandedCraters* = The natural bowl in the landscape means the sensor reads higher than average dust concentrations.

        DunaSrfLandedHighlands* = You fear the dust will never quite come out.
        DunaSrfLandedHighlands* = The more rarefied air up here displays marginally greater concentrations of argon and nitrogen over the denser carbon dioxide.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea* = The sensor beeps, clicks and whirrs as it works. You wish you had a protocol droid handy so you could tell what it was saying to itself.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea* = You put a small crystal from the subsurface ice into the analyzer to see what would happen. It melts, and after more heating the analyzer reports its vapor contains much more deuterium than Kerbin's.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin* = The dust is quite coarse here, and the gas mixtures are fairly Duna-standard.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin* = The dust particles here are slightly larger than those found in other biomes on Duna, due to the more arid conditions.

        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin* = Here the dust of the lowlands mixes with ice crystals blowing off the ice caps, creating reddish snow.
        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin* = The combination of the dust particles and ice crystals creates a reddish snow called cryosol that is unique to Duna's Southern Basin.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf* = The winds blowing down the canyon from the north carry with them the faintest traces of ice crystals.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf* = The detector finds a tiny wisp of krypton-then it's gone. Superkerbal better stay away.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon* = The fine dust here means the analyzer actually records the atmospheric composition for once without being filled with sand...let's see...lots of carbon dioxide, some argon and nitrogen...and not much else.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon* = The dust particles in the canyon can be stirred up by the wind, creating dust storms that can be very dangerous.

        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon* = There seems to be LOT more dust down here in the thicker canyon air, which acts as a dust sink for the surrounding hills.
        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon* = The atmosphere is thicker here compared to the other biomes on Duna.

        DunaFlyingHighWesternCanyon* = The computer asks you rather crossly why you're making it analyze a vacuum. Seems the air really is thin up here.
        DunaFlyingHighWesternCanyon* = The dust in the Western Canyon is very fine, and it can be quite harmful to equipment.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands* = The sensor registers the large amount of windblown ice crystals and lower dust count.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands* = The ice crystals in the air act as a reflector, causing the surface of Duna at the poles to be brighter than it would be otherwise.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters* = Lots of airborne ices-analysis reports they consist of varying ratios of hydroxic acid and carbonic anhydride. Sounds scary.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters* = The airborne ices are composed of a variety of different molecules, including water and carbon dioxide.

        DunaFlyingLow* = The atmosphere appears to be significantly less dense than that of Kerbin.

        DunaFlyingLowPoles* = Gas geysers firing below fill the atmosphere with dust and ice.
        DunaFlyingLowPoles* = The dust and ice particles are constantly being churned up by gas geysers, creating a haze in the atmosphere.

        DunaFlyingLowMidlands* = The analyzer develops a caking of dust, so you jolt the craft from side to side to shake it off.
        DunaFlyingLowMidlands* = This air is thin at best. The fine grains of dust that get caught in the intake don't help the scanner.

        DunaFlyingLowLowlands* = The air is so thin there's hardly any wind. You contemplate how well paper airplanes would work, absent-mindedly folding your mission papers into... *ahem*.
        DunaFlyingLowLowlands* = You could get used to this, flying serenely through air-that's-not-really-there while scanning it with a gizmo.

        DunaFlyingLowCraters* = It's very hard to take readings, as every few minutes you have to clear iron oxide dust from the sensors.
        DunaFlyingLowCraters* = You get distracted by staring at the crater and miss the readings, so you just note down '100% dust'.

        DunaFlyingLowHighlands* = Despite the dust storms, there's not much wind. The scanner indicates that the dust is incredibly small and easy to blow around.
        DunaFlyingLowHighlands* = Not much air up here to carry the dust, but air currents from orographic lift carry the finest of particles over the summits.

        DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea* = The inlet valve for the air has frozen shut yet again, reminding you that it's still freezing outside.
        DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea* = Carbon dioxide, argon, nitrogen and...iron oxide? You're pretty sure that last one isn't a gas.

        DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin* = The dust seems to stay low to the ground here, as there's not much off it off the ground.
        DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin* = The coarse dust doesn't seem to stay suspended in the atmosphere for very long.

        DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin* = The ice crystals appear to stay closer to the ground, up in the air it's mostly dust. And carbon dioxide. And nitrogen. And argon.
        DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin* = The heavy ice crystals remain close to the ground, while the dust gets blown up into the atmosphere by the wind.

        DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf* = The analyzer bleeps loudly over the noise of the wind, signifying the completion of its analysis.
        DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf* = The air here looks normal, if a little thicker thanks to the low altitude. And it's still really dusty.

        DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon* = Faint traces of ice crystals are detected, perhaps being carried into the canyon by the Northern Shelf winds?

        DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon* = Wow, that's a lot of dust down below. So much, it's still detectable in the air above.

        DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon* = No significant traces of water vapor up here. Or on the ground. Or anywhere else on Duna, for that matter.

        DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands* = Much of the atmosphere is particles that've blown off the surface. That, or we forgot to clean the sensor before departure.

        DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters* = The wind picks up, and a cloud of water and carbon dioxide ice crystals fills the air.

        DunaFlyingHigh* = Carbon dioxide, with appreciable amounts of argon and nitrogen and traces of oxygen and carbon monoxide are detected through spectroscopic analysis of the local atmosphere.

        DunaFlyingHighPoles* = A sharp spike in airborne ice crystals is detected as you fly through one of Duna's wispy polar clouds.

        DunaFlyingHighMidlands* = The concentrations of argon, nitrogen and other trace gases are significantly higher than the surface up here.
        DunaFlyingHighMidlands* = The relative absence of dust up here allows for largely uninterrupted atmospheric sampling.

        DunaFlyingHighLowlands* = The atmosphere here is largely devoid of the fine dust from the lower regions, but radiation levels are also almost certainly higher.
        DunaFlyingHighLowlands* = Still CO2. Come to think of it, we're actually at the same altitude as everywhere else, just further off the ground. You think.

        DunaFlyingHighCraters* = Looks pretty normal from up here. Ground topography doesn't seem to affect the upper atmosphere much.
        DunaFlyingHighCraters* = Although thin, Duna's atmosphere can be more than thick enough to aerobrake in.

        DunaFlyingHighHighlands* = Lots of carbon dioxide. The high compressibility and low density might make atmospheric entry heat less intense for landers.
        DunaFlyingHighHighlands* = Higher even than the mountaintops, extremely faint and wispy strips of cloud flow behind the mountain. Flying through them shows they are made of ice.

        DunaFlyingHighMidlandSea* = Duna's rarefied atmospheric gas mixture at these altitudes is starting to separate, and concentrations of gases fluctuate with altitude.
        DunaFlyingHighMidlandSea* = Concentrations of water vapor up here are slightly higher than the rest of the planet, but it's a small enough difference to be a blip.

        DunaFlyingHighNorthernBasin* = You have to crank the sensitivity on the detector all the way up to get any readings in the extra-thin air.

        DunaFlyingHighSouthernBasin* = Climate cells and northerly air currents ensure no ice is detected up here.

        DunaFlyingHighNorthernShelf* = The Northern Shelf and its influence on the atmosphere is far below you.
        DunaFlyingHighNorthernShelf* = A dust particle that gets caught in the sensor turns out to be from the Northern Basin-is this evidence of global air currents?

        DunaFlyingHighMidlandCanyon* = Now, the one time dust isn't an issue, the analyzer blows a fuse and stops working anyway. Poxy thing.

        DunaFlyingHighEasternCanyon* = The canyon is so large, it even causes the streams of upper-atmosphere dust and denser gases to sink into it.

        DunaFlyingHighWesternCanyon* = The computer asks you rather crossly why you're making it analyze a vacuum. Seems the air really is thin up here.

        DunaFlyingHighPolarHighlands* = The atmosphere here seems the same as it is anywhere else.

        DunaFlyingHighPolarCraters* = The inlet on the analyzer develops a layer of frost in the lower regions of the upper atmosphere. Curious, considering it didn't have any water on it.
