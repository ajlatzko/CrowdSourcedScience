        KerbinInSpaceLow* = Analysis of magnetometer data reaffirms Kerbin's impressive magnetic field, which effectively shields against solar radiation, preserving the safety of orbital operations within this altitude range.
        KerbinInSpaceLow* = Kerbin's magnetic field seems to be affected by the solar wind. This can cause the magnetic field to fluctuate in strength and direction.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = The magnetic field out here distorted by the presence of the Mun. This distortion can be seen as a series of bands of alternating magnetic field strength.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = The magnetic field fluctuations are more pronounced in high orbit, due to the weaker field and the influence of the solar wind.
